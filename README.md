# Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA

This project demonstrates how to perform time series forecasting using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model on a dataset of airline passenger numbers.

## Overview

Time series forecasting is a technique used to predict future values based on previously observed values. In this project, we use the ARIMA model to forecast the number of airline passengers over time, utilizing a dataset containing monthly passenger counts.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Airline Passengers dataset, which is publicly available. It contains the number of passengers flying each month from 1949 to 1960.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need the following Python packages:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `statsmodels`

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib statsmodels
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ahmdmohamedd/ARIMA-predective-analysis.git
    cd ARIMA-predective-analysis
    ```

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

3. Open the notebook `ARIMA_Time_Series_Forecasting.ipynb` and execute the cells to perform the analysis.

## Steps Included

1. **Load the Dataset**: Import the dataset and handle any missing values.
2. **Visualize the Data**: Plot the time series data to understand trends and patterns.
3. **Check Stationarity**: Use the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test to check if the time series is stationary.
4. **Differencing**: Apply differencing to make the series stationary if necessary.
5. **Determine ARIMA Parameters**: Analyze the ACF and PACF plots to choose the appropriate parameters (p, d, q) for the ARIMA model.
6. **Fit the ARIMA Model**: Fit the model to the data and make predictions.
7. **Visualize Predictions**: Plot the original data along with the forecasted values.

## Results

The final visualization shows the actual number of passengers and the forecasted values for the upcoming months.
